#### Have you ever wanted to correctly communcate with a freind or family member who is from a different generation, and thus uses completly different slang? Now that is finnaly possible with the still-in-development GEN-SLATER. Using a OPENAI API this application uses NEXT WORD PREDICTION MODELS to consistantly translate your slang to slang of another generation.
