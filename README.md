# gen-slater

Have you ever wanted to correctly communicate with a friend or family member who is from a different generation, and thus uses completely different slang? Now that is finally possible with the still-in-development GEN-SLATER. Using an OpenAI API, this application uses next word prediction models to consistently translate your slang to slang of another generation.

## Installation and Initialization

There are some very simple steps in order for you to be able to run this application yourself. Hopefully I will be able to push it to the web so that you won't have to care about these steps.

1. Clone git repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rrocketmann/gen-slater
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize your API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

4. Run application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
